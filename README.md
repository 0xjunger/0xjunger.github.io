# Hey, I'm JÃ¼nger!

I'm a Turkish physicist. While I used to work on lasers, my current focus is on particle physics and conducting experiments at CERN.
<ins>Nowadays, my work consists mostly of cryptography and mathematics rather than physics.</ins>


# Why I'm here?

I follow the [cypherpunk](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt) philosophy. In my opinion, privacy in the digital era is an essential requirement, not just an option. Therefore, I am committed to utilizing the necessary tools for creating privacy protocols.


# What I'm doing?

I am currently studying the mathematical concepts necessary for cryptography. I have provided introductory resources on basic cryptography and am currently applying fundamentals using <ins>Rust</ins> programming language.

We also develop decentralised applications for BlocklandLabs. We are currently developing our work on Starknet, and we will soon enhance our professionalism.
