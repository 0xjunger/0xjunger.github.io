# Hey, I'm JÃ¼nger!

I'm a Turkish physicist. While I used to work on lasers, my current focus is on particle physics and conducting experiments at CERN.
<ins>Nowadays, my work consists mostly of cryptography and mathematics rather than physics.</ins>


# Why I'm here?

I follow the [cypherpunk](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt) philosophy. Privacy in the digital era is an essential requirement, not just an option. Therefore, I am committed to utilizing the necessary tools for creating trustlessness protocols.


# What I'm doing?

I am currently studying the mathematical concepts necessary for cryptography. I have commenced studying fundamental cryptography resources and am presently applying this knowledge using the <ins>Rust</ins> programming language.

We also develop dapps for <ins>BlocklandLabs</ins>. We are currently developing our work on <ins>Starknet</ins>, and we will soon enhance our professionalism.
